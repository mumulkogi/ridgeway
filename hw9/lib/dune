; When <mode> is unqualified, Dune will assume that 
; the current directoryâ€™s subdirectories are part of the same group of directories. 
; In particular, Dune will simultaneously scan all these directories 
; when looking for OCaml/Reason files. 
; 
; This allows you to split a library between several directories.
